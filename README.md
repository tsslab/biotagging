# Biotagging


## Project Description

Interrogation of gene regulatory circuits in complex organisms requires precise
tools for the selection of individual cell types, as well as robust methods for tissue- specific labeling and biochemical profiling of target proteins. By exploiting multiple transgenesis strategies, we have developed a tissue-specific binary in vivo biotinylation system in zebrafish termed “biotagging”, a versatile methodology that uses genetically- encoded components to biotinylate target proteins, enabling in-depth genome-wide analyses of their molecular interactions. Using tissue-specific transgenic drivers and individual cell compartment effector lines from our “biotagging” toolkit, we demonstrate the specificity of our approach at the biochemical, cellular and transcriptional level. By characterizing the *in vivo* transcriptional landscape of migratory neural crest and myocardial cells in two different cellular compartments (ribosomes and nucleus), we identify a comprehensive network of protein-coding and non-coding RNAs and uncover cis-regulatory modules and regulatory logic conferring cell-specific identity, embedded in the complexity of the non-coding nuclear transcriptomes. Our study demonstrates that “biotagging” eliminates background inherent to complex embryonic environments and allows analyses of molecular interactions in any cellular context at highest resolution.

## Highlights

* Biotagging is a binary genetic system for tissue-specific, subcellular *in vivo* biotinylation in zebrafish.
* Biotagging enables comprehensive transcriptional pathway analyses of migrating neural crest and myocardial cells
* Strand-specific nuclear RNA profiling reveals tissue-specific bi-directional transcription across putative cis-regulatory elements and uncovers tight developmental regulation of a variety of non-coding RNA species.
* Molecular logic for cell identity is encrypted in the nuclear transcriptome, as revealed by analysing the migratory neural crest.
